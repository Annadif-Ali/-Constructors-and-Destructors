Constructors and Destructors
Aim
To study and implement constructors and destructors in C++.

Theory
Constructors and destructors are special member functions of a class in C++ that are used to initialize and clean up objects, respectively.

Constructors
Definition: A constructor is a special member function that is automatically called when an object of the class is created. It has the same name as the class and does not have a return type.
Purpose: To initialize the object's data members.
Types:
Default Constructor: Takes no arguments.
Parameterized Constructor: Takes one or more arguments.
Copy Constructor: Initializes an object using another object of the same class.
Move Constructor: Transfers resources from a temporary object to a new object (introduced in C++11).
